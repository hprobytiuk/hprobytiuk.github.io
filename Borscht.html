        <h1>Kolomyia’s Borscht</h1>
        <p>I strived also to help somehow people who were actually in Ukraine at that moment. At that time, my uncle’s colleague had founded a non-profit project to help Ukrainian soldiers to fight more effectively. I joined this project as a marketing manager for free. In the beginning, my responsibilities were to manage the Social Media of this project.</p>

        <h2>Smm Manager</h2>
          <p>In the beginning, the goal was to spread information about the project as quickly as possible through social networks and to attract people to donate to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine because we sent produced goods directly to the front line.</p>
          <p>What is Ukrainian dried borscht? This is an ecological dried soup made out of natural ingredients. The product lines of Kolomya's Borscht are different fast-cooking soups as well known as "Rolton" or "Mivina".</p>
          <p>But over time, we realized that the project would not survive simply on donations, so we decided to reorient ourselves into a semi-commercial project. Therefore, the strategy of social network development has radically changed. We began to look for ways of paid advertising with large coverage, using Facebook Ads and publishing in Ukrainian media.</p>
          <p>The logo was also made simply from a sketch by my roommate who also wanted to help the project in some way. Amazingly, he succeeded, and we now use his logo.</p>
          <p>The demand increased, and we understood that it was necessary to somehow optimize the order process. Therefore, we have moved on to the next stage.</p>

        <h2>"Web-designer"</h2>
        <p>The best way to automate sales is through a website. Therefore, since it was interesting to me, I undertook to develop the structure of the website as "wireframing", which we did for this assignment.</p>
        <p>In order to do this, I analyzed what people most want to see on a simple landing page. Also, the main goal was to convey to people our mission statements and information about who we are.</p>
        <p>As for me, I completed the task with a bang! I left this project because I didn't have a lot of free time and fulfilled the given goal - we launched the project from a marketing perspective. I was really happy when I looked at the website for the first time, as my website structure was used as a basis. But there was only a slight disappointment due to the choice of fonts. Despite this, the site perfectly fulfills its function!</p>
